            'After a short holiday and a lengthy conversation with a friend who is currently already a great software engineer, I decided to dedicate all of my time into studying Full-Stack Web Development. It was a rocky road to be sure but by December I had become increasingly proficient in both frontend and backend technologies; building a solid foundation in JavaScript, React and NodeJS as well as HTML and CSS. From there it was all projects and furthering my understanding of the tech industry. I am currently looking for my next opportunity to shine and perhaps lend my experience to a great team in the professional world',

I also helped design a lot of content for the systems that were shown on TVs in the hospitality and healthcare industry as well as configure them before installation. Lastly I aided in boosting revenue for established businesses by 20% through creative marketing strategies and targeted sales. It was at this job that I started to slowly get into tech and programming, but I would not invest a lot of time into it until I left the company.'
